## Summary

While Iowa is very different from New York, the dataset from NYC Citibike contains a lot of information that could help with the launch of Citibike in Des Moines (DM). DM Citibike should focus efforts on getting subscribers, as they are the people in would ride most of the Citibikes in NYC- roughly 4 times more than non-subscribers. These are likely locals who use the bikes mostly for 9-5 weekday commuting and day-to-day errands, whereas the single-use customers tend to use the bikes more on the weekends. Additional visualizations showing what time of day the bikes are checked out which also compares subscribers to customers could help to dig even deeper into this, and could be beneficial for the team as they seek to determine whether to cater more towards tourists or locals in Des Moines. Also, a visualization showing paths of the most popular routes (by mapping start and stop points per bike per trip) could be very useful in showing the places most likely to be traveled to, by whom, and when. This could make choosing sites for bike placements easier for Citibike in Des Moines.
